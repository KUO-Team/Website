              3. Consequences Of Unacceptable Behavior
            </h2>
            <p>
              Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with
              decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable
              behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in
              unacceptable behavior, the staff team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to
              and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without
              warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service). If you are
              subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify
              a staff member as soon as possible. Additionally, staff members are available to help
              community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
              experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">4. Scope</h2>
            <p>
              We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and
              other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and
              in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community
              business. This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable
              behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has
              the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
